Among Welsh voters, Reform UK is viewed as the most threatening prospect for government, with 61.5% describing a Reform-led administration as a 'nightmare scenario'—substantially higher than any other party. When those voters who expressed a desire to stop Reform UK were asked which party is best placed to do so, Plaid Cymru dominated with 57%, compared to just 16% for Labour. This finding underscores the realignment in Welsh progressive politics, where voters increasingly see Plaid Cymru rather than Labour as the primary vehicle for opposing right-wing populism in devolved elections.
